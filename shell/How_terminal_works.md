# What is terminal

Simply put, it's "the predecessor of UI (user interface)" in your computer.

- In the old days, when there is no Windows or Mac OS, "the shell" was the only way to interact with a computer.
- It's hard for non-programmer to use --- It take in commands from keyboard, and response everything in pure text.
- When PC (personal computer, aka your laptop) market emerge, Apple and Microsoft first try to reduce the learning curve of using computer for non-programmers.
- The solution is visualization, they invented GUI (graphic UI), so you can do things like drag-and-copy a file, double-click to open browser, in a visualized and animated way.
- Because it is so intuitive, it soon become popular, and become the major way of how everyone now interact with computer nowadays.
- That say,
  ( for nowadays programmers.)
