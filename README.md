# git-for-begineers-with-real-example
The core idea begind git and GitHub isn't that complex. But one of the biggest blocker for computer science n00bs to learn it is that it have so many new tech terms (e.g. repository, commits, pull request).

Instead of diving deep into those terms and confuse you with all git concepts, I will try to illustrate with by completing a real life task using common word that everyone can understand. After the practice we will recap what just happened and link them with "GitHub wording". 

# What is the example?
A professor want to publish a paper with two of his students. And they decide do it in the GitHub way :) 

# What is the GitHub way?
The are four important role in a typical GitHub workflow:

**Owner:** In our case the professor is the ownerï¼Œhe have full control over the book and is the one to decide what content should be in the final version.

**Contributer:** The two students are contributer, they may work on some chapter together or separately, but any of their writings need to be review by professor before going into final version of the book.

**Remote copy:** A cloud storage that stores the final version of the book, in our case is GitHub.

**Local copy:** Manuscript from professor and students, it is their draft version of the book and they can proofread each other's manuscript so that only the correct and best content goes into final version of the book.

# Let's start

## 1. Professor create a GitHub storage 
Visit https://github.com/new, create a new "repository". (It is really just a remote cloud storage that store some txt files)

## 2. Students setup their local copy

## 3. Professor add introduction section to GitHub 

## 4. Student A work on first chapter 

## 5. Student A submit review request for his first chapter

## 6. Professor provide feedback and ask for change 

## 7. Student A fix the typo and update his review request

## 8. Professor approved the request and merge Student A's work into GitHub

## 9. Student B update his localy copy and start to add content to first chapter

## 10. Student A in the mean time, start to add content to first chapter and create second chapter

## 11. Student B submit review request for his work

## 12. Professor approved the request and merge Student B's work into GitHub

## 13. Student A submit review request for his work

## 14. Professor approved the request but not able to merge Student A's work

## 15. Student A resolve the conflicting line and update the request

## 16. Student A merge his work into GitHub
